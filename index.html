    <h1>Advantages and Disadvantages of Autonomous Driving and How They Contrast</h1>
    <h2>abstract</h2>
        <p>In this article we talk about the advantages and disadvantages of autonomous driving.<P/>
        <p>We want to talk about the impact of advantages and disadvantages on the future of autonomous driving.<p>
        <p>I will give my conclusion. I think the future of autonomous driving is bright.<P>
        <hr>
<p>First, we need to understand the definition of self-driving cars from the Internet. The following is the definition from Wikipedia. Self-driving cars are also called driverless cars, computer-driven cars, driverless cars, robot cars or self-driving cars. They are a kind of need. Vehicles with driver assistance or no need to control at all. As autonomous vehicles, self-driving cars can sense their environment and navigate without human operation. So, we can know that based on the special characteristics of self-driving cars, it is destined that it is not a product that can be created in a short period of time. It requires a lot of time and scientific research to mature slowly.<p/>
    <p>Today, driverless cars in the world are divided into six levels of autonomous driving: L0 manual driving, L1 assisted driving, L2 partial autonomous driving, L3 conditional autonomous driving, L4 highly automated driving, and L5 fully autonomous driving. Most cars in modern society are still purely human-driven at the L0 level, and most self-driving cars are still being researched. Only a few countries and regions have places where self-driving cars can be tested.<p/>
    <p>And now I want to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of self-driving cars. I think self-driving cars have many advantages, such as avoiding traffic accidents caused by human factors, reducing the safety gap required for driving, reducing the need for traffic police and other laborers, and self-driving cars can also have higher speed limits. These are all its advantages. These advantages are benefits that cannot be brought by human-driven cars.<p/>
    <p>On the contrary, self-driving cars also have many shortcomings, such as the stability of the self-driving system and the reliability of the software, which will determine whether the self-driving car is safe, compensation issues after accidents, the decline in employment in the driving industry, and the most serious ones The problem is the ownership of driving rights at a life-or-death moment. These issues are all issues that seriously affect the development of autonomous vehicles, so autonomous driving still has a long way to go.<p/>
    <p>Taking all things into consideration, I think the advantages of autonomous driving outweigh the disadvantages. First, in terms of traffic accidents, the number of car accidents caused by manual driving every year is much higher than the data shown by autonomous vehicles in experiments. Secondly, in terms of the future of autonomous vehicles, the impact on society cannot be ignored. It can calculate more accurately and satisfy the travel needs of many people at the same time. This is very important in the future because the number of people on the earth will increase in the future, so the advantages of autonomous driving will be infinitely amplified and passed. Experts predict that self-driving cars will become more and more perfect in the future and will reduce the number of vehicles in the world to one-tenth. So overall, the advantages of self-driving cars far outweigh the disadvantages.<P/>
